# Intrusion-Detection-System-IDS-
This project investigates the application of GRU and LSTM models for Network Attack Detection, trained on the CIC-IDS2017 dataset with diverse network flow features. Model performance was evaluated and further improved through hyperparameter optimization, including adjustments to learning rate and optimizer.
